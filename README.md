Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera)
========================================================

This project demonstrates how to collect, work with and clean a data set. We work with data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone. Data of the project are found at

The script run_analysis.R will create a tidy data set called "tidydata.txt" following the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
